IDEAS:
MAKE WEATHER GRAPHIC LIGHTER/DARKER BASED ON LOCAL TIME!
MAKE WEATHER GRAPHIC BACKGROUND 'SKY' COLOUR CHANGE IF IT'S CLOUDY/STORMY/RAINY ETC
ADD OPTION TO AUTO-LOCATE LOCATION FOR AUTOMATIC WEATHER (although this may not work since suburbs are 100% supported by API)


FIX THE WHITE SPACE AT BOTTOM OF PAGE


// for the api debugging, make it so you can type 'api <location> and then it'll give you the api for that location (using the split input to insert it into the query field of the api call).
