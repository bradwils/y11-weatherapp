IDEAS:
MAKE WEATHER GRAPHIC LIGHTER/DARKER BASED ON LOCAL TIME!
MAKE WEATHER GRAPHIC BACKGROUND 'SKY' COLOUR CHANGE IF IT'S CLOUDY/STORMY/RAINY ETC
ADD OPTION TO AUTO-LOCATE LOCATION FOR AUTOMATIC WEATHER (although this may not work since suburbs are 100% supported by API)


FIX THE WHITE SPACE AT BOTTOM OF PAGE


// for the api debugging, make it so you can type 'api <location> and then it'll give you the api for that location (using the split input to insert it into the query field of the api call).


for text, arrange string to display then split into array
display it one by one so it looks like it's being typed.

in addition to above, have option for fast animations + slow animations
slow (default) would have fades + typing effects (etc), fast would have none of them.
