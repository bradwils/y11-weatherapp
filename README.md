- Expired API key means that it is dynamically unusable.

- However, by entering 'overide (option)' into the query bar, you can force preview the different weather animations (although the provided weather data is null).
(option) can be either: <br>
thunderstorm<br>
drizzle<br>
rain<br>
snow<br>
clear<br>
clouds<br>
