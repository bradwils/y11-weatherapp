In apiscript; under the weather (path: data.weather), you then need to focus the array #0, so to be able to specify 
for further information from it, you need to do daata.weather[0].etc.


the canvas uses it's own weird little pixel system to move things, so it's differnet to the reported pixel size from the html element.


for timing; you need to give the website a second to load all of the images and other variables.
if you run functions straight away using the images and canvas it may not work, so if you want something to run fast maybe setTimeout
